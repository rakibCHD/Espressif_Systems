The ESP32-CAM is a compact development board with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a built-in camera (OV2640).
This is the guidence to setting it up, uploading code, and accessing the camera stream.
🧰 Required Components

    ESP32-CAM module (AI Thinker)
    USB-to-Serial Adapter (FTDI232, CH340, CP2102) (for programming)
    Jumper wires (female-to-female)
    Breadboard (optional, for stable connections)
    5V power source (via USB or external supply)

========================
 1. Wiring Connections
========================

The ESP32-CAM doesn’t have a built-in USB port for programming. Use an FTDI USB-to-Serial adapter:
FTDI Module	ESP32-CAM
3.3V/5V*	5V (ESP32-CAM)
GND	GND
TX	U0R (RX on ESP32-CAM)
RX	U0T (TX on ESP32-CAM)

🔔 Important:
✅ Power with 5V (not 3.3V) for stable camera operation.
✅ Connect IO0 to GND while uploading code. (Remove after upload for normal boot)

======================
2. Arduino IDE Setup
======================
🛠️ Install ESP32 Board Support:

    Open Arduino IDE → File > Preferences
    In Additional Board URLs, add:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

    Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search ESP32, and click Install.

==============================
3. Select Board & Settings
==============================

In Arduino IDE, configure the following under Tools:
Setting	Value
Board	AI Thinker ESP32-CAM
CPU Frequency	240MHz (WiFi/BT)
Flash Frequency	80MHz
Flash Mode	QIO
Partition Scheme	Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)
Upload Speed	115200
Port	Select the correct COM port
Programmer	esptool

===================
4. Uploading Code
===================
🚀 Example Code: Use the built-in CameraWebServer example:

    Go to File > Examples > ESP32 > Camera > CameraWebServer.
    In the code:
        Select the camera model:

#define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER

Enter your Wi-Fi credentials:

        const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
        const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

    Connect IO0 → GND before uploading.
    Click Upload and wait for completion.

==============================
 5. Access the Camera Stream
==============================
    After uploading, disconnect IO0 from GND.
    Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) and press the ESP32-CAM RESET button.
    Look for this output:

if WiFi connected it shows:
Camera Ready! Use 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' to connect.
Go to any browser and type 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' to access camera.
